It now can handle some basic functions:

* One rotary encoder is changing FX parameters like amp's knobs do. A push selects next FX
* Another encoder changes presets: first four is hardware (in-amp), the other 24 are hardcoded yet
* The four buttons switches FX on and off (DRV, MOD, DLY, RVB) or at your choice
* Long pressing the first button invokes amp info screen
* Long pressing the fourth button invokes not-implemented-yet mode ) 
but it's buggy and cut yet.

It's gonna be a standalone bluetooth footswitch for Spark amp to use in "gig mode", ie to switch between tones (4 stored within the amp, and a reasonable number, say 20, 50 or 100 of presets stored in on-board flash), or just turn On/Off effects inside a tone with just one tap.

These presets will probably be accessible via the on-board web server thru WiFi connection (AP/Infrastructure mode). Or in some other way.

## ToDo

- [ ] Total bypass: switching all the effects OFF and then return to the previous state
- [ ] Storing presets in ESP's filesystem
- [ ] Accessing presets thru web-based UI via WiFi
- [ ] (?) "Scenes" mode. Remember the setups within one Tone and map them to the buttons. Switching between such scenes should be (or not: subject to test) fast enough to perform live.

## Hardware

Wiring: Coming soon

Hardware in the photos:

* DOIT ESP32 DevKit v1
* 4 buttons
* 2 rotary encoders with buttons
* SSD1306 duo-color OLED display (just top 16 lines of pixels are always yelow, and the rest are always blue, you can't manage individual pixel color)
