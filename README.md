# Yet another bluetooth pedal for the PG Spark practice amp
It now can handle some basic functions, but it's extremely buggy and cut yet.
It's gonna be a standalone bluetooth footswitch for Spark amp to use in "gig mode", ie to switch between tones stored within the pedal, or turn On/Off effects inside a tone with just one tap. So it's gonna keep a reasonable number of presets as file(s) in on-board flash.
This config will probably be accessable via on-board web server thru WiFi (AP/Infrastructure mode). Or in some other way.

## Hardware
It's ESP32 based.
Its hardware may include some momentary buttons, and optionally rotary encoders.

## Wiring
Coming soon
