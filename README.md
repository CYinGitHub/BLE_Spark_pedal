# Easy Spark
It aint functioning yet, BUT:
It's gonna be a standalone bluetooth footswitch for Spark amp to use in "performance mode".
ESP32 based.
It may have some momentary buttons, and optionally rotary encoders.
It's gonna keep a reasonable number of presets as a config file(s) in on-board flash.
This config will probably be accessable via on-board web server thru WiFi (AP/Infrastructure mode). Or in some other way.
