# Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) pedal for the PG Spark Amp

As it now uses BLE it's possible to connect both mobile app and this pedal to Spark Amp. To do this you should first connect the pedal, and then launch the app, skipping the connect option. After that manually connect "Spark 40 Audio" to your mobile/tablet. Done, you can use audio/video options of the app, and all you have in the pedal. Note, that Tonecloud and preset editing from the app ain't available in this mode.

What it can for the time being:

*   "EFFECTS" mode: on-off individual effecs in a chain
    *   The first rotary encoder is changing FX parameters like amp's knobs do. A push selects next FX. During this operation the second encoder changes to prev/next FX knobs. 
    *   The second encoder changes presets: first four is hardware (in-amp), the other 24 are hardcoded yet. Pushing it envokes not-implemented-yet PRESETS mode )
    *   The four buttons switches FX on and off (DRV, MOD, DLY, RVB) or at your choice
    *   Long pressing the first button invokes amp info screen
    *   Long pressing the second button: bypassing all the 7 effects, and then any button returns the amp to the previous state

*   "PRESETS" mode: switching between four configured presets as fast as Spark can. Switch between such configurations.
    *   In progress

*   "SETTINGS" mode: some parameters stored in flash
    *   Not implemented   

It's gonna be a standalone BLE footswitch for Spark amp to use in "gig mode", ie to switch between tones (4 stored within the amp, and a reasonable number, say 20, 50 or 100 of presets stored in on-board flash), or just turn On/Off effects inside a tone with just one tap.

These presets will probably be accessible via the on-board web server thru WiFi connection (AP/Infrastructure mode). Or in some other way.

## ToDo

*   Storing presets in ESP's filesystem (partially done)
*   Implement "PRESETS" mode (merged with SCENES, in progress)
*   "SCENES" mode. Switching between 4-preset combinations (In progress).
*   Implement "ORGANIZE" mode (not gonna be here)
*   Implement "SETTINGS" mode
*   Accessing presets thru web-based UI via WiFi.
*   Storing master volume for every preset slot in flash.
*   There's a raw idea of auto-normalizing presets' master volumes.
*   Attaching addressable RGB LEDs.
*   Change to BLE (done, debugging).
*   Battery power supply and maybe battery management (In progress, probably will only work with Heltec).

## Software HowTo

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) is the recommended IDE for build and upload. It is a free add-on for MS VSCode which makes coding much simplier and satisfying.

1. Follow the instructions to install [VSCode and PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
2. Install Git
    - On Windows, install git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
    - On macOS, install Command Line Tools for Xcode running `xcode-select --install` via Terminal. Remember to run the command every time you update your macOS.
3. Launch VSCode and run the following commands (you can type there or select commands from the list):
    - from View->Command Palette... (Ctrl+Shift+P)
        - Git: Clone
        - You will be asked for the URL of the remote repository (<https://github.com/copych/BLE_Spark_pedal>) and the directory to place the local repository.
    - At the top left find PlatformIO->Project Tasks and select your environment (i.e. esp32doit-devkit-v1)
        - Click "Build" under General
        - Click "Upload" under General
        - Click “Upload File System Image” under Platform. (!!! CRITICAL !!! DON'T SKIP THIS STEP !!!)

Hardware in the photos:

*   DOIT ESP32 DevKit v1
*   4 buttons
*   2 rotary encoders with buttons
*   SSD1306 duo-color OLED display (just top 16 lines of pixels are always yelow, and the rest are always blue, you can't manage individual pixel color)
